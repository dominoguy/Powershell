Manual RSYNC
Build exclude file

ribackup
check user/blong - checking first two directories to build the exclusiion list - how big can this list be?
also check first level dir and just exempt the first level (-Group)
If last entry is still blong
then
note the directory it is in and start there
if not the last entry
enter -user/blong/* into exclude directory

it will continue to build the two directory list until it switches dir
dont add to exclude list until done with top level dir or end of file

Using rsync we can also exclude files and directories based on a pattern that matches the file or directory name.

For example, to exclude all .jpg files, we run the below command.

rsync -a --exclude '*.jpg*' src_directory/ dst_directory/
But if we wish to exclude all other files and directories except the files ending with .jpg then here is the command for it.

rsync -a -m --include='*.jpg' --include='*/' --exclude='*' src_directory/ dst_directo

exclude-file.txt

file1.txt
dir1/*
