Manual RSYNC
Build exclude file

ribackup
check user/blong - checking first two directories to build the exclusiion list - how big can this list be?
also check first level dir and just exempt the first level (-Group)
If last entry is still blong
then
note the directory it is in and start there
if not the last entry
enter -user/blong/* into exclude directory

it will continue to build the two directory list until it switches dir
dont add to exclude list until done with top level dir or end of file

Using rsync we can also exclude files and directories based on a pattern that matches the file or directory name.

For example, to exclude all .jpg files, we run the below command.

rsync -a --exclude '*.jpg*' src_directory/ dst_directory/
But if we wish to exclude all other files and directories except the files ending with .jpg then here is the command for it.

rsync -a -m --include='*.jpg' --include='*/' --exclude='*' src_directory/ dst_directo

exclude-file.txt

file1.txt
dir1/*
dir2

right click the folder inside and select properties
Under directory you can give the drive mapping if it is there or use the UNC path
T:\Radan or \\ace-nas-001\Radan
this is a live connection so using unc, drive does not need to be mapped.

While it is unclear how servers are initially breached, the threat actor's attack starts with the execution of a file named 'Tiworker.exe,' which masquerades as a legitimate Windows file.

This executable is the initial staging payload for GhostEngine, a PowerShell script that downloads various modules to conduct different behaviors on an infected device.

When Tiworker.exe is executed, it will download a PowerShell script named 'get.png' from the attacker's command and control (C2) server, which acts as GhostEngine's primary loader.

This PowerShell script downloads additional modules and their configurations, disables Windows Defender, enables remote services, and clears various Windows event logs.

Next, get.png verifies that the system has at least 10MB of free space, which is necessary for furthering the infection, and creates scheduled tasks named 'OneDriveCloudSync,' 'DefaultBrowserUpdate,' and 'OneDriveCloudBackup,' for persistence.

GhostEngine also runs several files that allow the malware to gain persistence, meaning it loads each time the infected machine restarts. To do this, the file responsible, name get.png, creates the following scheduled tasks with SYSTEM, the highest system privileges in Windows:

OneDriveCloudSync using msdtc to run the malicious service DLL C:\Windows\System32\oci.dll every 20 minutes (described later)
DefaultBrowserUpdate to run C:\Users\Public\run.bat, which downloads the get.png script and executes it every 60 minutes
OneDriveCloudBackup to execute C:\Windows\Fonts\smartsscreen.exe every 40 minutes.
A separate component can act as a backdoor that allows the attackers to further download and execute malware on the infected machine. A PowerShell script titled backup.png “functions like a backdoor, enabling remote command execution on the system,” the researchers wrote. “It continually sends a Base64-encoded JSON object containing a unique ID, derived from the current time and the computer name while awaiting base64-encoded commands. The results of those commands are then sent back.”

Right click Terminal Server Client and select Export to back up this registry entry.

Then, right click Terminal Server Client and select New -> DWORD.

Rename it as UseURCP with value 0.

The next time the user logs in, this setting will take effect.

This basically tells the rds service to stop trying to compensate for jitter on the line.
